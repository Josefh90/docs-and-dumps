#📚  Docs-and-dumps

A personal collection of technical notes, READMEs, cheatsheets, and guides.  
This repo serves as my second brain — a place to document what I learn, fix, or build.

## 📁 Topics
- 🐧 Linux & Shell
- 🛡️ Pentesting Tools
- 🐳 Docker & Containers
- 🌐 Web & DevOps
- 🔧 Git & Workflows
- And more...

> Notes written by me, for me — but shared for anyone who might find them useful.
